## ðŸ“¢ UPDATED FOR NEXT.JS 14 ðŸ“¢

- We have updated this starter for Next.js 14. It is built on top of the [@agility/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agility/nextjs) npm package specialized for app router.

### Caching

There are 2 new env var settings that are used to control caching.

- `AGILITY_FETCH_CACHE_DURATION`

  - this setting sets the number of seconds that content items retrieved using the Agility Fetch SDK will be cached as objects.
  - Works best to use this with on-demand invalidation. If your hosting environment doesn't support this, set it to `0` to disable caching, or set it to a low value, like `10` seconds.

- `AGILITY_PATH_REVALIDATE_DURATION`
  - this value controls the `revalidate` export that will tell next.js how long to cache a particular path segment. Set this to a longer value if you are using on-demand revalidation, and a lower value if not, and if your users expect content changes to be reflected earlier.

Agility will NOT cache anything in preview mode :)

#### On Demand Revalidation

- If you are hosting your site on an environment that supports Next.js on-demand revalidation, then you should be using the `AGILITY_FETCH_CACHE_DURATION` value and actively caching items returned from the SDK.
- the revalidation endpoint example is located at `app/api/revalidate/route.ts` and will revalidate the items based on the tags that are used to cache those object.
- The `lib/cms-content` has examples of how to retrieve content while specifying the cache tags for it.

## Changes

This starter now relies on component based data-fetching.

## About This Starter

- Uses our [`@agility/nextjs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agility/nextjs) package to make getting started with Agility CMS and Next.js easy
- Support for Next.js 14
- Connected to a sample Agility CMS Instance for sample content & pages
- Supports [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) for image optimization using the `<Image />` component or the next.js `<Image />` component for images that aren't stored in Agility.
- Supports full [Page Management](https://help.agilitycms.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055805831)
- Supports Preview Mode
- Supports the `next/font` package
- Provides a functional structure that dynamically routes each page based on the request, loads Layout Models (Page Templates) dynamically, and also dynamically loads and renders appropriate Agility CMS Components (as React Server Components)
- Supports component level data fetching.

### Tailwind CSS

This starter uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a simple and lightweight utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### TypeScript

This starter is written in TypeScript, with ESLint.

## Running the Site Locally

### Development Mode

When running your site in `development` mode, you will see the latest content in real-time from the CMS.

#### yarn

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`

This will launch the site in development mode, using your preview API key to pull in the latest content from Agility.

#### npm

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

### Production Mode

When running your site in `production` mode, you will see the published content from Agility.

#### yarn

1. `yarn build`
2. `yarn start`

#### npm

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run start`

## Accessing Content

You can use the Agility Content Fetch SDK normally - either REST or GraphQL within server components.

## Deploying Your Site

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js website to production is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js, or [Netlify](https:netlify.com). Vercel and Netlify are all-in-one platforms - perfect for Next.js.
